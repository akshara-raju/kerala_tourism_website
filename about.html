      <div class="kerala">
          <p id="aboutkerala"> For your info, Kerala means ‘The land of Coconuts’ in Malayalam (the main language in the south). It’s an absolute pleasure to be surrounded by these giant tropical trees. Sun is king in Kerala, 8 months of it for 4 months of rain, amazing ! On top of the fabulous weather, Kerala boasts some mesmerizing lanscapes and beautiful nature.The vast networks of rivers and canals that span throughout the west of the state are a must-see. It’s gorgeous and peaceful and a chance to see how the local people live along the banks. It’s worth taking a houseboat to truly get the full experience.</p>
      
          
          <p id="aboutkerala">Kerala is also about divine beaches and transparent waters of the south arabian sea. In the center, the agricultural valleys and its plains and green hills are beautifully designed, offering a horizon of tea plantations. In the East, you get dazzling views from the mountains over the deep valleys and forests of the Ghats. Fauna and flora are abundant in Kerala.</p>

         
          <p id="aboutkerala">For those looking for a good rest, there are plenty of splendid beaches in the south (Marari, Koyalam, Varkala etc…) You can also enjoy a unique experience, restful and rather luxurious, on a traditional houseboat, along the backwaters of Alleppey .
            Another very relaxing and enjoyable exerience, is Ayurvedic treatments which have nursed people back to health for centuries, or simply doing yoga in sumptuous decors.</p>

            
            <p id="aboutkerala">IF you’re rather sporty, why not trek in the Western Ghats, its totally worth the view. Classed as Unesco heritage, and camping under the stars in Kolikkumalai. It’s also worth going via Calicut or Wayanad, and have fun with outdoor activites such as zipwiring over a lake, canoeing, mountain biking, archery, bamboo rafting or even zorbing.</p>
            <p id="aboutkerala">For the curious cats, you could check out the tea plantations near Munnar, discover what those spices you use for home cooking all the time actually look like when fresh, in of the Amaravathi plantations. You could explore the thousand year old caves in Edakkal and learn more about the region in one of the many museums of the Muziris program.</p>
            <p id="aboutkerala">Culture and art is at the heart of the of Kerala life. There are a number of temples and and frequent Hindu festivals that liven up the roads and villages all year round. When you’re there you’ll no doubt bump into one of their colourful and noisy processions accompanied by elephants, musiciens, and dancers, fervently celebrating their beliefs.</p>
            <p id="aboutkerala">Kerala hosts several unique Artforms, which have all passed the test of time and still find audiences among the young and the old alike. From the vibrant Kathakali, which speaks through subtle expressions to the Ottamthullal, which provides social commentary through its lyrical narration, Kerala is home to some of the exuberant artforms of the world.</p>
