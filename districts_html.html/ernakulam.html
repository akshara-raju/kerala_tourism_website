                <p>The magnificent Mattancherry Palace built by the Portuguese in the year 1557, is considered to be one of the important places to see in Ernakulam. Popularly known as Dutch Palace, its imposing structure and architecture resembles a typical traditional Kerala house with 4 individual wings and a patio in between. Located on Palace Road, a place noted for being the former trade centre, it is flanked by backwaters of the Arabian Sea and is a short distance away from the heart of Ernakulam.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>This seaside town in the south-western part of main Kochi is popular for its old-world colonial charm, and still showcases every single cultural change it has gone through over the centuries. One can spot remnants of Portuguese and Dutch colonialism in this quaint city which is dotted with similar structures and has an overall ambience that brings to light the colonial powers that once ruled over the place. The fort region of Kochi has witnessed the rise and fall of great powers including the Portuguese, Chinese and the Dutch, before it came under the nation-wide British rule in the 18th century. Fort Kochi is lined with old European structures, churches and other architectural buildings which transport you back to a different era. Unlike most other forts in Indian history, Fort Kochi is not about historical fortifications, canons and ruins of old palatial buildings. Instead, it houses the vibe of an ancient colonial city with its cobbled streets, colourful and charming buildings and a picturesque view of the beach, and is one of the best places to see in Ernakulam.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>This magnificent palace located in Bolgatty Island of Ernakulam is one of the oldest existing Dutch palaces that is situated outside Netherlands, and is an exquisite example of the Kochi style of architecture. Built in 1744 by Dutch traders, it is one of the major tourist attractions and was later extended, and gardens were landscaped around it. The palace has been remodelled today as a luxury hotel and is a favourite among couples. The palatial structure is surrounded by carefully manicured gardens that make for a delightful spot for an evening stroll. The palace is divided into three distinct sections, the Main Block, the Marina Block and the Mansion Block, overlooking the city’s International Marina. 4 well-appointed luxury rooms are fitted with plush amenities like swimming pool, nine-hole golf course, health club, in-house restaurants and conference hall, which warrant a comfortable stay. The edifice is extremely plush and exudes a regal vibe with their lavish furniture and is truly priceless. From the comfort of your room, you can watch ships entering the Kochi port through the estuary or simply hop aboard a boat yourself and explore the very famous backwaters of Kerala.</p>
