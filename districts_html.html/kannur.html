        <p class="district">Kannur is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It was once an ancient trading port. Enduring monuments such as 16th-century St. Angelo Fort, once occupied by European colonial forces, show the city’s significant role in the spice trade. Housed in a former palace, the Arakkal Museum highlights Kerala's one Muslim royal family. The palm-fringed sands of Payyambalam Beach run along Kannur’s western shore.</p>

                <p>It is also known as the Kannur Fort and is a world heritage site. This fort was built on the coast of the Arabian Sea in 1505. It was made by Dom Francisco de Almeida, who was the first Portuguese Viceroy of India. It is just about 3 kilometres away from Kannur railway station and the nearest airport is of Calicut which is 93 kilometres away from this great fort.

                    At present, this fort is under the maintenance of the Archaeological Survey of India. This one should definitely be among the places to see in Kannur as you get to explore an ancient fort and enjoy scenic views of the sea. Just sit around and enjoy the show of the waves hitting the rocks of this timeless fort.</p>

                <p>If you like to visit historical places or you are an art lover, a visit to the Arakkal Museum should be on your list. The museum is named after the Arakkal family. It is the only royal Muslim family in Kerala. It is dedicated to the 16th century Kannur dynasty.

                    This museum is located inside the residence of the Arakkal family, i.e. Arakkalkettu- Arakkal Royal Palace. So, it is both the royal residence and the museum, which stands tall, and is a testimony to the Muslim architecture of those times. There are antiques, silver, art and heritage furniture pieces that you can see in this museum. The Durbar Hall was earlier the official venue for kings and their nobles’ gathering. This museum is maintained by the Arakkal Family Trust.</p>
