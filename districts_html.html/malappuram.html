        <p class="district">Malappuram district has a rich and vibrant history. The military headquarters of the Zamorins of Kozhikode since ancient times, this district was the site for many of the Mappila Revolts (uprising against the British East India Company in Kerala) between 1792 and 1921. Malappuram literally means a land atop hills and the region is enriched by three great rivers flowing through it - the Chaliyar, Kadalundi and the Bharathapuzha. </p>

                <p>Padinharekara Beach or Padinjarekara Beach is one of the most scenic places to visit in Malappuram for a serene experience. One of the most amazing things to do in Malappuram is to experience a sunset from this beach. 

                    Located at the very end of the famous Tipu Sultan Road, you can also get mesmerized with the view of the rivers Bharathapuzha and Tirurpuzha before they merge with the Arabian Sea. You can find palm trees surrounding the white sandy beach, attracting tourists in large numbers.</p>

                <p>The region of Malappuram is full of backwater lakes created inland, and one of the most famous ones in the region is the Biyyam Kayal. Located close to Ponnani in the Malappuram district has recently been revamped to the status of an adventure zone of the area. 

                    The local councils have set up facilities of a number of adventure and water sports here, like Speedboats and water scooter rides. Apart from these, there are a number of rest houses on the bank of the lake as well, visited highly by locals at the time of Onam.</p>

                <p>Another attraction of Malappuram that is often compared to the famous town of Ooty, Kodikuthimala is definitely a sight for the sore eyes. A hill station of Kerala, the place is perched on a height of about 522 m above sea level, and is the highest point in the Amminikkadan hills. 

                    Once the spot where the Britishers once hoisted their flag, the spot was opened for tourism only a few decades ago, with a large area of the place marked already for future development projects. There is a watch tower on the top of the hill from where tourists can get a panoramic view.</p>

                <p>A basin at the base of waterfalls where people can enjoy a dip in the pond is something everyone wants to have an experience. Keralam Kundu Waterfalls are undoubtedly the best of all Malappuram Tourist Places, and that is why people keep flocking here to have an experience of the mystical. 

                    The water flows in from the forest of the western ghat and forms a pool of crystal clear water at the base of the falls. Also, it is believed that the water has many medicinal properties.</p>

                <p>The River of Bharata, also known as Nila, the Bharathapuzha River is a west-flowing river in the state of Kerala, and is the second longest river in the state. The river has been an integral part of life in the southern regions of Malabar. The name Nila has been given to the river to show the importance of it being more than just a river, as there are several mentions of the river in the ancient Hindu scriptures. 

                    All along the river, there are about 11 dams made to use its waters for the purpose of irrigation. Culturally, the river has an importance in a number of parts of the state, like the famous Kerala Kalamandalam which is housed on the banks of the river.
