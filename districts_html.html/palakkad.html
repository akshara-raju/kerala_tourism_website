        <p class="district">Celebrated as the Granary of Kerala, Palakkad is a vast stretch of fertile plains interspersed with hills, rivers, mountain streams and forests. The gateway to Kerala from the north, a 40 kilometre break in the mountains known as the Palakkad Gap gives access to this land situated at the foot of the Western Ghats.</p>

                <p>This is the place for the people who want to connect with the history of Palakkad. Commonly known as Tipu’s Fort, the gigantic Palakkad Fort is located in the heart of the city. The glorious attraction of Kerala, Palakkad Fort woos tourists with its mesmerising architecture. Built by Haider Ali in 1766 AD, the fort campus houses Hanuman (Anjaneya) Temple, which will surely leave you spellbound with its unique interiors. Rising above a tiny hill, historians say that the colossal architecture was built as a purpose of improving communication between Palakkad and Coimbatore. Today this Fort is a protected monument under Archaeological Survey of India. The sober majesty of the Fort walls reminds one of the old tales of valour and courage. Presently, the fort is serene, filled with art and offers the spectacular view of the surrounding area.</p>
