        <p class="district">A hilly province of pristine splendour, the district of Pathanamthitta is hailed as the headquarters of pilgrim worship in Kerala. Three rivers course through its prosperous terrains comprising natural divisions of the lowlands, the midlands and the highlands. Interspersed with temples, rivers, mountain ranges and coconut groves, more than fifty per cent of the total area of this region is covered by forests.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>This temple is one of the rare specimens of rock-cut temples in Kerala. The archaeological department preserves it as a monument and is one of the three rock-cut temples in Kerala.

                    The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva. A three feet high Shiva Linga is enshrined in the square cave, and idols of Ganapathy, Maharshi and Dwarapalakas are enshrined within as well.
                    
                    Built on the banks of the River Manimala, it is an 8th century construction in the Pallava style of architecture and is hence considered a place of great archaeological importance. The temple is located 28.3 km from Pathanamthitta town and can be reached by bus or private vehicles.</p>

                <p>The permanent home for the royal family of Pandalam, Pandalam palace is situated on the banks of river Achankovil 10 km from the town of Adoor.

                    Although a significant part of the original building has vanished by flood and fires, a few still remain. At present, there are two palace complexes – the Valiyakoikkal Temple and the Kaipuzha Temple.
                    
                    On the left bank of Achankovil river is the Valiya koikkal temple and about one kilometre away, on the right, is the Kaipuzha temple.
                    
                    It is believed that the royal family of Pandalam have descended from the Pandya Kings of Madurai. This Palace is not just a place with historical importance, but a considerable religious greatness as well.</p>

                <p>Perunthenaruvi is another favoured spot of visitors to Pathanamthitta, it is one of the best waterfalls in Kerala. The name Perunthenaruvi means “the honey stream”.

                    This beautiful waterfall recommended by both domestic and foreign tourists is situated on the banks of the Pamba river at a distance 28.7 kms from Pathanamthitta.
                    
                    From a height ranging from 60 to 100 feet the water falling down a rocky bed and descending into a pool through multiple streams is a sight to behold. This is a wonderful place to spend time swimming and playing in the water with friends and family, enjoying the scenic views.</p>

                <p>Aruvikkuzhy Falls is a gem in the crown of Pathanamthitta’s natural beauty. Located 7km from Kozhencherry and about 2km from Thadiyoor the waterfall is a visually pleasing sight.

                    This falls often gets confused for Aruvikkuzhi Waterfall in Kottayam.
                    
                    In Malayalam, the word ‘Aruvikkuzhy’ means “deep water stream”. Several streams conjoin to form this waterfall and with time it has become an ideal picnic spot and movie location.</p>
